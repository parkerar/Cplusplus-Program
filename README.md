Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This project was pulling a report in of temperature in degrees fahrenheit and converting it to a report with temperatures in degrees celsious.
    
What did you do particularly well?
    I did particularly well with creating a conversion in an outfile from a pulled report.
    
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I could enhance my code by being more technical in coding as i am sure there was an easier way to convert these reports.
    
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    The part i found most challenging in this code was converting fahrenheit to celsious. I was able to pull the report and create an outfile report. However, it was converting. After watching multiple youtube videos on how to make changes to a pulled file, i was able to piece it all together and complete the project.
    
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    I think learning how to pull information from a file  and integrating into your code will be very benifecial with other projects as they will only get bigger and more in dept.
    
    
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I made this program maintainable by keeping it to the basics, readable by keeping it as clear as possible and not adding unneeded information, adaptable but having the able to change some lines, file names and what you need it to do to be able to complete another project using this base line.
